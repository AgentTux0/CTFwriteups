Jess doesn't get enough sleep, since he's such a gamer so in this challenge, you'll be staying up with him until 4:00 in the morning :D on a Monday! Let's go, gamers!

When visiting this page I was greeted by a countdown for the monday after the end of the CTF. We can't wait this long... If we peek about in the developer console we can see that we have a cookie called gamerfuel, set to monday at 04:20. Let's try changing it to the current date and time...
