So in this challenge we are provided with a url: https://riceteacatpanda.wtf/uwu.
When we follow this url we are presented with several pages that redirects us to another page, and they are all filled with uwus.
In some of the pages we can see glimpses of non uwu text. This indicates that we probably will be able to find our flag in the sea of uwu.
To explore this further I quickly made a script that pulled the content from each of the pages, and stripped them of any uwus.
So I get a fun little story, but there seems to be no flag in here? This is what threw me off and made me fail this challenge.
After reading another writeup I learned that the flag contained uwu, thus my script broke the flag.
I then did some modifications on my first script to make it.
The script will loop until there are no more redirections indicated in the pages, or if it finds the flag with the given regex.

The script is a bit overkill, but I made it for practice more than functionality, it would probably be more efficient to use burp or to save the sites and find the flag manually.
